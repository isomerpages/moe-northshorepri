### Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) for use of EdTech Resources

**Purpose of the Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)**

Technology is an essential part of learning in today’s world. 

This Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) establishes guidelines on the appropriate use of EdTech resources to help you understand how to use these resources safely and responsibly, in line with efforts to develop your digital literacies and growth as digitally responsible citizens.

EdTech resources include the following, but are not limited to:
-	Learning devices (e.g. school devices)  
-	ICT system accounts (e.g. Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS), iCON); and school internet networks.

**General**
1. You should not attempt to access data, system and information that you are not authorised to. 
2. You are reminded that the use of learning devices and school’s EdTech resources should solely be for the purpose of learning.

	• racially and/or religiously insensitive,
	• vulgar and/or offensive, or
	• hurtful to others.
4. You should not use any devices to
	• store, modify, create or share content (e.g. documents, presentations, pictures and videos) that is inappropriate (e.g. indecent, pornographic, defamatory, hurtful to self or others).

### Student Learning Space

**HOW SINGAPORE STUDENT LEARNING SPACE SUPPORTS LEARNING**  
As part of Ministry of Education's (MOE) commitment to nurture future-ready learners, an online learning platform known as the _**Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS**)_ is made available to the students.  
  
The SLS is an online platform with tools and curriculum-aligned resources for all students to learn at their own pace and collaboratively. With the SLS, students can take greater ownership of their learning and pick up skills and habits that prepare them for lifelong learning. Teachers will also use the SLS to complement classroom teaching and learning.
