learners, an online learning platform known as the&nbsp;<strong><em>Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS</em></strong><em>)</em>&nbsp;is

<p>The SLS is an online platform with tools and curriculum-aligned resources
for all students to learn at their own pace and collaboratively. With the
SLS, students can take greater ownership of their learning and pick up
skills and habits that prepare them for lifelong learning. Teachers will
also use the SLS to complement classroom teaching and learning.</p>
