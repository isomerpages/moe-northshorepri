the school values. They are expected to demonstrate Self-discipline, eMpathy,
Adaptability, Respect to school staff, peers and school property and Tenacity.</p>

The school adopts the Restorative Approach to manage students. This approach
encourages students to be accountable for their actions and empowering
them to exercise better self-control and self-discipline in future. It
also helps the child to recognise that we address specific behaviours as
the problem, and not the child. Where necessary, the assistance of students’
parents/guardians will be sought to obtain home support for remedial action.</p>
