<strong>Northshore Primary School is in the news!</strong>
<p>We are proud of our students for their active participation and curiosity in wanting to know more about STEM and History through their Chinese Language lesson.   
We had a virtual lesson on the ‘Elephant Clock’ from Kulangsu Gallery of Foreign Artefacts from the Palace Museum Collection (故宫鼓浪屿外国文物馆) for our Chinese Language lesson. The lesson was reported on</p>
