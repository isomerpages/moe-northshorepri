Mrs Lam believes that every child can be nurtured to be a great learner, and she is always looking out for talents and gifts in every child under her care in order to realise their potential.  She believes that everyone with the correct mindset to learn and the heart to contribute can indeed do so, regardless of his perceived capacity. She also feels that everyone, regardless of physical ability, can stand tall and make a mark for himself, as long he tries.  Mrs Lam looks forward to begin her tenure as the Principal of Northshore Primary School, where she hopes to nurture children holistically, helping them contribute actively to the community in their own unique ways as blossoming individuals who ‘Love to Learn, Learn to Love and Lead to Love’.
