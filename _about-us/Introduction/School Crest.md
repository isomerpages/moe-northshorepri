# **School Crest**

![](/images/nsps.jpg)

Our school colours are Blue and Orange. Blue signifies stability, wisdom and confidence while Orange signifies creativity, optimism and energy.   

The N and S in the center of the school crest are shaped like a chain to denote the strong link between the students and the school. The N also represents the True North, an internal compass, which the school hopes that our students will have within them to guide them to succeed in life.

The center ring is designed to look like a compass and the helm of a ship. Below the center ring lies an open book and dots that represent the digital world to encourage our students to acquire knowledge and skills through various means.Â 

Northshore Primary believes in inculcating our students with the school S.M.A.R.T. values so that they navigate successfully through life challenges and opportunities with the right core values, beliefs and attitudes.
