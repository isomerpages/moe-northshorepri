# **School Song**
**Courageous Explorers**  

[Link to School Song](https://go.gov.sg/nsps-schoolsong)

The sunrise lights up  
the sea of possibilities before us all.  
With courage we will explore  
Our strengths and knowledge of the world.   

Each challenge an adventure, to anchor our character.  
We ride the waves, we steer ahead.  

Courageous Explorers we are  
Raise our sails and soar.  
We learn with passion, dare to dream  
Serve with all our hearts.  

Courageous Explorers we are  
We always find a way.  
We learn with passion, dare to dream  
Serve with all our hearts,  
Northshoreans!
