# **Our Curriculum**

Our curriculum is holistic and balanced, focusing on differentiated and experiential learning.

The school aims to prepare students with the capabilities to think critically, demonstrate creativity and imagination, communicate effectively using various media, work collaboratively with others, and self-direct their own lifelong learning. They will be equipped with relevant competencies and knowledge for them to apply their learning to new and unpredictable challenges and opportunities they will face. Our students will also be developed holistically into citizens anchored on **SMART** values who have the skills and heart to contribute back to their communities.

The learning experiences designed for our students would be developmentally appropriate, differentiated and experiential to meet different needs of our students and prepare them for work and life.

As Singapore takes steps towards being a Smart Nation, one of our curriculum focus is also on preparing our students to think computationally in the digital age and ensuring relevance to the future workplace and society.
