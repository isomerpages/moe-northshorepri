# **PE and Health Education**

**Overview**  
The Northshore Primary Physical Education Programme aims to develop every student’s physical, mental, ethical and social wellness. We believe that PE is just as important as other subjects.  Through PE, students acquire the knowledge, skills, right attitudes and values towards the pursuit of a lifelong physically active and healthy lifestyle individually and with others. Using the skills acquired, we encourage our students to be engaged in Sports in both recreational and competitive platforms.

**Key Programmes**  

**Primary 3 Swimsafer Programme**  
Our Primary 3 students will be embarking on their Swimsafer Programme in Term 2. SwimSafer is a national water safety programme introduced by the National Water Safety Council (NWSC) in July 2010, with SwimSafer 2.0 launched in 2018. The programme aims to equip pupils with basic swimming skills as well as water safety awareness. The lessons are currently conducted during curriculum time and they are carried out by MOE-accredited vendors.

**Primary 1 and 2 Lower Primary Games Day**   
The school organises the Lower Primary Games Day as a whole school in August. On this fun-filled day, our students displayed some of the skills learnt during PE lessons as they competed with friends from other classes.

**Primary 1 to 4 “I am SAM (Sportsman, Artist, Musician) Week”**  
Our students do not just learn about PE, Art and Music content during classroom lessons. During this week in October, they will be having activities during Recess that will excite them and turn them into young Sportsman, Artists and Musicians. For our I am Sportsman activity (2022), our students raced as “Formula 1” drivers as they controlled their skates around a circuit as they competed with their friends. Our Primary 3 students (2023) became archers as they engaged in an archery activity.

**Primary 3 SEP (Sports Education Programme)**  
The school partners Sport Singapore (SportsSG) in introducing unique sports programmes to our students to encourage sports participation and increase sporting opportunities. SEP programmes caters for development of skills and sports knowledge of students and help promote active participation of sports. It also promotes team spirit and character building, and to arouse interest in continual sports participation amongst students.   

Our Primary 3 students participate in 5 lessons of Handball to understand the skills and to pit their skills against their friends of other classes at the end of the programme. 

**National Kidney Foundation (NKF) Week**  
The school partnered NKF to introduce the importance of kidney health to our students with fun and engaging activities. The students learnt about the ways to keep our kidneys healthy by reducing salt intake and sweetened drinks, keeping a healthy lifestyle through engaging in outdoor activities, and also having enough rest every night. One of the highlights was the opportunity to board the NKF bus, which was equipped with interactive exhibits and augmented reality technology to make understanding kidney diseases and its preventive measures fun!
