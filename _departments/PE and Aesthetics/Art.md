**Art @ Northshore Primary School**  
  
Art Education in primary school aims to allow every student to enjoy art, communicate visually and make meaning through connecting with society and culture. It provides a platform for all students to use Art as a medium to learn about oneself and the world.

The art syllabus framework emphasises three significant concepts which are: art helps us see in new ways, art tells stories about our world, and art influences how we live. These big ideas are further explored through three learning domains: see, express, and appreciate. By engaging in these learning domains, students develop key competencies, including observe-inquire, create-innovate, and connect-respond. The competencies are then broken down into learning outcomes, which are organised based on students' cognitive and artistic development. By repeatedly discussing and exploring these big ideas, students gain an understanding of the value of art and develop skills, knowledge, and values that help them become active artists and informed audiences.

In Northshore Primary School, the art curriculum structures cognitive, psychomotor and affective development of our students through the five processes of **Art Inquiry**:

**Connect &amp; Wonder**    
Students investigate what inspires them, what they are curious about and what they want to express through their artwork. It requires them to connect with their emotions, experiences, and the world around them and wonder about the possibilities. Students are encouraged explore their creativity, experiment with different mediums and techniques so as to develop their own unique artistic voice.

**Investigate / Play**  
Students explore different materials, techniques, and processes to discover new possibilities and push creative boundaries. Students are encouraged to approach the creative process with a sense of curiosity and playfulness as well as to embrace a willingness to take risks and explore new possibilities.

**Make**    
By exploring different techniques and experimenting with different materials to create art, students can discover new ways of expressing their ideas and bring their creative vision to life. Students are encouraged to take ownership of their artistic learning and develop a sense of confidence in their ability to create meaningful artwork.

**Express**    
Students can gain a deeper understanding of their artistic intent and develop their ability to communicate their ideas visually. Students are encouraged to be intentional about the message they want to convey through their artwork as well as to consider the best way to showcase their work to their intended audience.  






**Lower Primary**    
Hence, in Lower Primary, students will be introduced to Art via themes and topics that encompass self-identity and individuals who are close to them; family and friends. Students will explore those themes and topics via creating portraits, masks, sculptures and puppets.  
  
**Middle Primary**  
In Middle Primary, students will explore Art themes and topics based on places such as their neighbourhood, classroom and school that have a direct influence on them. They will be printmaking, painting sceneries, constructing a diorama and sculpture, and designing a batik piece. In Primary 4, students will be involved in the Museum Based Learning (MBL) programme to explore places of interest, and flora and fauna in Singapore.  
  

**Upper Primary**   
In Upper Primary, students will focus more on contemporary and abstract Art themes and topics. Students will learn the importance of Art in creating awareness and as a change agent for social and environmental issues (local and global\[GSM1\]&nbsp;). Students will achieve their goals with illustrations, installations, photography and action painting.  
  
Throughout these 6 years, students will be exposed to various art forms mainly, 2D art, 3D art, Digital art as well as Traditional art.
