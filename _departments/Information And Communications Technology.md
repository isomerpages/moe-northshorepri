# **Information And Communications Technology (ICT)**

**Empowering Northshoreans for a Technology-Transformed World**  
In line with the EdTech Masterplan 2030 vision to “prepare students for a technology-transformed world,” Northshore Primary School is committed to nurturing digitally empowered, future-ready learners and innovators. Guided by our ICT Committee, we adopt a whole-school approach to equip every Northshorean with the digital literacy and technological skills needed to thrive in an increasingly digital world.

Our students develop essential digital competencies through the **“Find, Think, Apply, Create”** framework, which is embedded into a progressive ICT curriculum. This curriculum integrates Baseline ICT Standards and New Media Literacies to ensure a strong foundation in digital learning.
