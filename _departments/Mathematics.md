# **Mathematics**

**I.&nbsp;Mathematics Curriculum Framework (Revised - 2021 Syllabus)**

![](/images/M1.jpg)

**II.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Primary Mathematics Syllabus aims to enable all students to:**

* acquire mathematical&nbsp;concepts and skills for everyday use&nbsp;and for continuous learning in Mathematics.  
* develop&nbsp;thinking, reasoning, communication, application and meta-cognitive skills&nbsp;through a mathematical approach to problem-solving.    
* build&nbsp;confidence&nbsp;and&nbsp;foster interest&nbsp;in Mathematics.

New 

**III.&nbsp; &nbsp; Engaging Pedagogy – Activity-Based Learning (ABL)**

* ABL advocates the Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (CPA) approach in the teaching and learning of Math.  It creates learning opportunities in using teaching aids like manipulatives to engage students in constructing and co-constructing conceptual understanding.  Students become Active Learners as they move through the different stages of learning, whilst strengthening their mastery of Math skills and concepts.  ABL also leverages the use of technology to make good teaching better. Teaching with technology for active learning creates participatory, connected and reflective Math classroom to nurture future ready learners.

**IV.&nbsp; &nbsp; Key Programmes**

* **Enhanced Learning Support for Mathematics (Enhanced LSM)**  
The programme is designed to provide early intervention in Mathematics to students who need additional support in acquiring basic numeracy skills from Primary 1 to 4.  Students identified for Enhanced LSM programme are supported by trained Enhanced LSM teachers.  

The goals of Enhanced LSM are to:  

‐ equip students with mathematical knowledge, skills and dispositions so that they can learn mathematics with their peers; and  
‐ help students achieve an age-appropriate mathematical age.

* **Math @ Play**  
Math@Play programme, a unique feature of the Mathematics curriculum at Northshore Primary, aims to foster the joy of learning in Mathematics. Math@Play programmes gamify Math skills and concepts into games-based activities to stimulate greater students’ interests and build their confidence in learning Math.  Students are provided with opportunities to contextualise their learning of Math concepts in “real-world” (game) setting.  Such experiences allow students to seek out strategies to win games and experience fun in learning Math while reinforcing their mathematical skills and concepts.

* **Math  UPS<sup>2</sup> Approach to Problem Solving**  
Problem solving is an essential component in the teaching and learning of Mathematics.  Students will be introduced to the Math UPS<sup>2</sup> and encouraged to use varied strategies to solve problems, to seek alternative solutions to problems and to create, formulate or extend problems.

**IV.  Enhanced Learning Support for Mathematics (Enhanced LSM)**

The programme is designed to provide early intervention in Mathematics to students who need additional support in acquiring basic numeracy skills when they enter Primary 1.  Students identified for Enhanced LSM programme are supported by trained Enhanced LSM teachers. 

The goals of Enhanced LSM are to:

* equip students with mathematical knowledge, skills and dispositions so that they can learn mathematics with their peers; and
* help students achieve an age-appropriate mathematical age.
