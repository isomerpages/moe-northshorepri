**I. Mathematics Curriculum Framework (Revised - 2021 Syllabus)**

![](/images/M1.jpg)

**II.  The Primary Mathematics Syllabus aims to enable all students to:**

* acquire mathematical concepts and skills for everyday use and for continuous learning in Mathematics.  
* develop thinking, reasoning, communication, application and meta-cognitive skills through a mathematical approach to problem-solving.    
* build confidence and foster interest in Mathematics.

**III.    Syllabus Organisation for Primary 1 and Primary 2 Topics**

**IV.    Key Curriculum Approach**

Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (CPA) approach is a key curriculum approach in the teaching and learning of Math. The CPA approach creates learning opportunities in using teaching aids like manipulatives and digital tools to engage students in constructing and co-constructing conceptual understanding. Students at Northshore become Active Learners as they move through the different stages of learning, whilst strengthening their mastery of Math skills and concepts.

Students were engaged in activity-based learning to compare numbers up to 10, using manipulatives like snap link cubes and paper cut-outs.

Students learnt to use Mathematical language; more than, fewer than and the same number, to compare the numbers of the different-coloured cubes.

Students are engaged in activity-based learning using iPad.

**V.  Enhanced Learning Support for Mathematics (Enhanced LSM)**

The programme is designed to provide early intervention in Mathematics to students who need additional support in acquiring basic numeracy skills when they enter Primary 1.  Students identified for Enhanced LSM programme are supported by trained Enhanced LSM teachers. 

The goals of Enhanced LSM are to:

* equip students with mathematical knowledge, skills and dispositions so that they can learn mathematics with their peers; and
* help students achieve an age-appropriate mathematical age.

**VI. Math @ Play**

Math@Play programmes, a unique feature of the Mathematics curriculum at Northshore Primary, aim to foster the joy of learning in Mathematics. Math@Play programmes gamify Math skills and concepts into games-based activities to stimulate greater students’ interests and build their confidence in learning Math.  Students are provided with opportunities to contextualise their learning of Math concepts in “real-world” (game) setting.  Such experiences allow students to seek out strategies to win games and experience fun in learning Math while reinforcing their mathematical skills and concepts.
