**Our Curriculum**  
Our Primary 1 English syllabus is developed based on the MOE English Syllabus 2020 and aligned to the STELLAR 2.0 Programme (Strategies for English Language Learning and Reading).  
  
STELLAR is an interactive literacy programme that fosters confidence in learning English using children’s literature. Students will also engage in various theme-based experiences which deepen their learning and understanding.

**Our Programmes for Primary 1**  

**(i)    Learning Support Programme (LSP)**  
The Learning Support Programme (LSP) is a MOE-developed early intervention effort to help students strengthen their basic literacy skills. Identified Primary 1 students will receive additional help in oral and reading skills in English through a daily 30-minute lesson conducted within curriculum time. The aim of the programme is to equip these students with basic oral language, reading and spelling skills in English so that they can learn in the regular classes.  
  
**(ii)     Read On Board**  
 In collaboration with National Library Board, students get to read school-loaned story books from NLB. They will also get to participate in various organised activities and borrow books from NLB Mobile Library.  
For Silent Reading, Primary 1 students are required to read an English storybook, every odd week, from the time they arrive at their classrooms to 7.30am. He/She can read any book of his/her choice during this time. Students can also read a variety of stories from a range of class library books available. We hope to cultivate a routine of self-directed and independent reading, as well as inculcate a love for reading.  
A period each week in the English curricula is dedicated to teach library etiquette, skills and expose students to various genres of stories. The students can definitely look forward to more exciting times ahead with upcoming library, adopting the theme **‘To Travel Far, There Is No Better Ship Than A Book’**.  
  

**(iii)     Reader’s Theatre & Poetry Recitation**  
To promote creativity and self-confidence, students will be engaged in story-telling or recite poetry using drama conventions. Students will learn how to work with one another and express themselves with confidence and clarity.  
  
**(iv)     Learning Through Games and Activities**  
To promote critical thinking and sportsmanship, students get to play and have fun through English-based educational games and activities during lessons. The department also encourages active participation in the annual EL Fiesta, a carnival of language games and fun.
