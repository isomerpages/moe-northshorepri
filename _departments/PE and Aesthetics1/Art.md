**Art @ Northshore Primary School**  
  
Art Education in primary school aims to allow every student to enjoy art, communicate visually and make meaning through connecting with society and culture. It provides a platform for all students to use Art as a medium to learn about oneself and the world.

The art syllabus framework emphasises three significant concepts which are: art helps us see in new ways, art tells stories about our world, and art influences how we live. These big ideas are further explored through three learning domains: see, express, and appreciate. By engaging in these learning domains, students develop key competencies, including observe-inquire, create-innovate, and connect-respond. The competencies are then broken down into learning outcomes, which are organised based on students' cognitive and artistic development. By repeatedly discussing and exploring these big ideas, students gain an understanding of the value of art and develop skills, knowledge, and values that help them become active artists and informed audiences.

In Northshore Primary School, the art curriculum structures cognitive, psychomotor and affective development of our students through the five processes of **Art Inquiry**:

**Connect &amp; Wonder**    
Students investigate what inspires them, what they are curious about and what they want to express through their artwork. It requires them to connect with their emotions, experiences, and the world around them and wonder about the possibilities. Students are encouraged explore their creativity, experiment with different mediums and techniques so as to develop their own unique artistic voice.

**Investigate / Play**  
Students explore different materials, techniques, and processes to discover new possibilities and push creative boundaries. Students are encouraged to approach the creative process with a sense of curiosity and playfulness as well as to embrace a willingness to take risks and explore new possibilities.

**Make**    
By exploring different techniques and experimenting with different materials to create art, students can discover new ways of expressing their ideas and bring their creative vision to life. Students are encouraged to take ownership of their artistic learning and develop a sense of confidence in their ability to create meaningful artwork.

**Express**    
Students can gain a deeper understanding of their artistic intent and develop their ability to communicate their ideas visually. Students are encouraged to be intentional about the message they want to convey through their artwork as well as to consider the best way to showcase their work to their intended audience.

**Reflect**    
Students critically evaluate their own artwork and learning process. They also consider how well they are learning and how they can apply what they have learned to their next artwork. In doing so, students can identify areas for improvement, celebrate their successes and develop a deeper understanding of their own artistic practice. Students are encouraged to take an active role in their own learning, to be self-aware and reflective as well as to continually strive to improve their skills and abilities.  

**Key Programmes**  

**‘I am SAM’ week**  
**(Sportsman, Artist, Musician)**  
During I am SAM week, students have an opportunity to creatively express themselves beyond the curriculum by exploring various artistic concepts using digital tools. Through interactive games and visual art experiences, students will be able to reinforce and apply what they have learned in the classroom while also expanding their creativity in collaboration with their peers.
