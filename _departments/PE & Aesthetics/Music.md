# **Music**

At Northshore Primary, we believe that all children are musical and have the innate ability to listen, sing, dance, play and express themselves musically.  We have developed a well-tailored curriculum which provides different learning experiences to develop students’ musical abilities through the E-C-A (Experience-Concept-Application) approach.

The music programme aims to

a) Develop awareness and appreciation of music in local and global cultures   
b) Develop ability for creative expression and communication through music  
c) Provide the basis to develop an informed and life-long involvement in music
