# **Learning for Life Programme (LLP)**

**Overview** 

The Northshore Primary Learning for Life Programme (LLP) is titled OCE@N (Outdoor Education and Caring for our Environment @ Northshore). We envisioned to nurture in the students the courage to explore the environment around us with a passion to learn through play, and a willing heart to serve the community.  It will create various platforms for the students to learn about the environment through Outdoor Education. Every student and teacher will be engaged in projects that will extend their learning to the community to be stewards of environment. We aim to develop students’ critical thinking skills and to build character through experiential learning and exploring sustainability issues. Students will also be taught Outdoor Education knowledge and skills through authentic learning experiences.
