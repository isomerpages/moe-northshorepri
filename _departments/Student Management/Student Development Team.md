# **Student Development Team**

The Student Development Team (SDT) strives to create a caring and supportive school environment where every student feels a sense of belonging, builds positive relationships, and enjoys learning. By fostering engagement, motivation, and self-belief, SDT empowers students to take ownership of their growth. The team also prioritizes a psychologically safe space that nurtures resilience and student agency while providing tailored support and interventions for specific student groups to ensure their well-being and success.

The Student Development Team (SDT) adopts a structured, level-specific approach to nurturing students' growth in learning and care. In **Lower Primary**, the focus is on self-awareness and self-management, encouraging students to take responsibility for their actions and words. As they progress to **Middle Primary**, they learn to build positive relationships within the school through self-management and relationship skills, fostering a sense of care for their peers. By **Upper Primary**, students are guided to extend their care beyond the school community, becoming self-directed learners and responsible citizens who collaborate and excel together. This progressive framework ensures holistic development, equipping students with the values and skills needed for personal and social success.  

**Key Programmes**  

**S.M.A.R.T Beginning - Learn and Grow Programme**  
To ensure a smooth transition for our students and their parents, the programme is held during the first few days of school. There are opportunities for students to interact with classmates and teachers and learn about the school compound and rules.
