# **Student Development Team**

The Student Development Team (SDT) strives to create a caring and supportive school environment where every student feels a sense of belonging, builds positive relationships, and enjoys learning. By fostering engagement, motivation, and self-belief, SDT empowers students to take ownership of their growth. The team also prioritizes a psychologically safe space that nurtures resilience and student agency while providing tailored support and interventions for specific student groups to ensure their well-being and success.
