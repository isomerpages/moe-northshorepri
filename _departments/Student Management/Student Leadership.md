# **Student Leadership**

At Northshore, we develop student leadership in each and every Northshorean.  We hope to develop Northshoreans into responsible and conscientious individuals. By partaking in various leadership roles and responsibilities, every Northshorean will be shaped into confident leaders who will lead from their heart.

Our leadership framework provides opportunities for students to grow in responsibility and leadership skills, with each tier designed to challenge and support their personal growth. The framework is structured across three distinct tiers, allowing students to progressively take on more significant roles.

**Tier 1: Class Committee Roles – Introduction to Leadership**  
In Tier 1, every student has the opportunity to participate in class committee roles. These positions offer a first step toward leadership, providing students with hands-on experience in organising and working with others. It is a great introduction to the responsibilities and teamwork needed to succeed as a leader, setting the foundation for future leadership opportunities.

**Tier 2: Specialist Leaders – Developing Leadership Skills**  
In Tier 2, students from Primary 3 and Primary 4 are selected as specialist leaders, responsible for leading teams of Junior Prefects, Peer Support Leaders (PSLs), and CCA Leaders. These leaders play a more focused role in school life, guiding their teams and contributing to the smooth running of various activities. Specialist leaders refine their leadership skills and take on greater responsibility, creating a bridge between the foundational roles of Tier 1 and the executive positions in Tier 3.

**Tier 3: Executive Leadership – Excellence and Mentorship**  
Tier 3 is reserved for students who demonstrate excellence in leadership. This tier includes our Head Prefect, Vice Head Prefect, Executive Committee Members, Senior Prefects, PSLs, and CCA Leaders. These students take on the highest level of responsibility, not only leading by example but also mentoring and guiding students from lower tiers. Their leadership extends throughout the school, serving as role models in character, academic achievement, and community involvement.

Students are given the opportunity to self-nominate for leadership roles. For the senior prefects’ role, the students will also campaign to garner the support of the school population for their nomination and appointment. All student leaders are guided to perform their roles diligently. Student Leaders are developed in both their interpersonal and intrapersonal skills through the exposure and experiences provided in their roles to lead the school community.

**Roles and Responsibilities of Student Leaders (Tier 2 and Tier 3)**  
Our student leaders at Northshore Primary School perform various duties that help to shape a positive and well-functioning school environment.  

•	Recess Duty: Prefects are responsible for ensuring order and discipline during recess, helping to create a safe and respectful environment for all students. They are also tasked with resolving any issues that may arise, promoting the values of kindness and respect among their peers.  
•	Recess Games: Peer Support Leaders (PSLs) play a vital role in facilitating fun and engaging games for students to enjoy during recess. This responsibility allows PSLs to foster a sense of community, encourage teamwork, and ensure that all students have a positive and enjoyable break.  
•	School Events: Student leaders also assist in organizing school events such as Teacher’s Day, contributing to the celebration and appreciation of teachers and staff.  
•	Voices of Northshoreans: At Northshore Primary School, every student has a voice in shaping the school’s future. Through Voices of Northshoreans, students are encouraged to share their ideas on how to improve the school environment. Their suggestions are carefully reviewed by a dedicated team of teachers and Prefects before being submitted to the Principal for final consideration. Successful ideas that enhance the school experience are implemented, and students who contribute meaningful changes are recognized for their efforts. As a token of appreciation, specially made bookmarks are given to students who have suggested meaningful and feasible ideas. This initiative empowers students to take an active role in making Northshore Primary a better place for everyone. Every idea counts, and every voice matters!

As ambassadors for Northshore Primary School, student leaders are expected to model our school values. They set a positive example for others, inspiring their peers to embrace leadership opportunities and contribute to a strong, supportive school community.
