# **Student Leadership**

**Student Leadership at Northshore Primary School**  
At Northshore Primary School, one of our school’s visions is having a **Heart to Serve**. Guided by this vision and anchored in our SMART values of **Self-discipline, Empathy, Respect, Adaptability, and Tenacity**, the Student Leadership Programme provides meaningful opportunities for students to grow as responsible and caring leaders.  

Through structured leadership roles and guided experiences, students develop confidence, responsibility, and strong interpersonal and intrapersonal skills. These experiences support their holistic development and prepare them to contribute positively to the school and the wider community.

**Our Student Leadership Framework**  
Northshore’s Student Leadership Framework provides a clear and progressive pathway for leadership development. Structured across four tiers, the framework guides students from leading themselves to serving beyond the school. Each tier builds on the previous one, allowing students to take on increasing responsibility while strengthening character and leadership capacity.

**Tier 1: Leadership for Self**  
**Developing Personal Responsibility**  
Leadership begins with self. In Tier 1, all students are taught to take ownership of their actions by practising the school’s SMART values in their daily routines and behaviour. Through classroom expectations and personal responsibilities, students develop self-discipline, demonstrate respect, and build tenacity. This tier establishes the foundation for leadership by emphasising self-management and accountability.

**Tier 2: Leadership for Class**  
**Serving and Supporting Peers**  
Tier 2 focuses on leadership within the class community. Students take on class-based roles and peer support responsibilities, learning to serve others with empathy and work collaboratively. Through these experiences, students practise adaptability, develop communication skills, and contribute to a positive and respectful class environment.
At this tier, student leaders also support school life through specific responsibilities. Peer Support Leaders (PSLs), for example, facilitate simple and inclusive recess games, encouraging positive interactions, teamwork, and a sense of belonging among students. These responsibilities help students learn how to care for others while contributing to a joyful and supportive school environment.

**Tier 3: Leadership for School**  
**Leading Through Service**  
Tier 3 comprises school-based leadership roles such as Prefects, Peer Support Leaders (PSLs), CCA Leaders, Senior Prefects, and the Executive Committee (EXCO). Collectively, these student leaders play an important role in supporting the daily operations of the school and promoting a positive school culture.
Student leaders assist in maintaining a safe and orderly environment, particularly during recess, where Prefects support their peers by guiding behaviour and addressing minor issues with care and respect. They also support school routines, facilitate peer engagement, and contribute to the planning and conduct of school programmes and events such as Teachers’ Day.

Through the Voices of Northshoreans platform, student leaders help encourage student participation in shaping the school environment. Students are invited to share ideas and suggestions to improve school life. These ideas are reviewed by a team of teachers and Prefects before being submitted to the Principal for consideration. Feasible and meaningful suggestions are implemented where appropriate, and students who contribute constructive ideas are recognised for their efforts. This platform reinforces the belief that every voice matters and empowers students to take ownership of their school community.
The EXCO provides overall coordination and leadership direction, working closely with teachers to support school initiatives. EXCO members also mentor and guide other student leaders, helping them grow in confidence, adaptability, and tenacity as they carry out their responsibilities.

**Tier 4: Leadership for Community**  
**Serving Beyond the School**  
Tier 4 provides opportunities for students to extend their leadership beyond the school. Through community engagement and service-learning experiences, students apply the school’s SMART values in authentic contexts. These experiences help students develop empathy, adaptability, and a strong sense of social responsibility while contributing meaningfully to the wider community.

**Leading with a Heart to Serve**  
At Northshore Primary School, student leaders are ambassadors of the school. They are expected to model the SMART values in their conduct and interactions, serving others with responsibility and care. Through consistent service and positive influence, student leaders support the daily life of the school and help create a safe, caring, and respectful environment for all.

At Northshore, we develop student leadership in each and every Northshorean.  We hope to develop Northshoreans into responsible and conscientious individuals. By partaking in various leadership roles and responsibilities, every Northshorean will be shaped into confident leaders who will lead from their heart.

Our leadership framework provides opportunities for students to grow in responsibility and leadership skills, with each tier designed to challenge and support their personal growth. The framework is structured across three distinct tiers, allowing students to progressively take on more significant roles.

**Tier 1: Class Committee Roles – Introduction to Leadership**  
In Tier 1, every student has the opportunity to participate in class committee roles. These positions offer a first step toward leadership, providing students with hands-on experience in organising and working with others. It is a great introduction to the responsibilities and teamwork needed to succeed as a leader, setting the foundation for future leadership opportunities.

**Tier 2: Specialist Leaders – Developing Leadership Skills**  
In Tier 2, students from Primary 3 and Primary 4 are selected as specialist leaders, responsible for leading teams of Junior Prefects, Peer Support Leaders (PSLs), and CCA Leaders. These leaders play a more focused role in school life, guiding their teams and contributing to the smooth running of various activities. Specialist leaders refine their leadership skills and take on greater responsibility, creating a bridge between the foundational roles of Tier 1 and the executive positions in Tier 3.

**Tier 3: Executive Leadership – Excellence and Mentorship**  
Tier 3 is reserved for students who demonstrate excellence in leadership. This tier includes our Head Prefect, Vice Head Prefect, Executive Committee Members, Senior Prefects, PSLs, and CCA Leaders. These students take on the highest level of responsibility, not only leading by example but also mentoring and guiding students from lower tiers. Their leadership extends throughout the school, serving as role models in character, academic achievement, and community involvement.

Students are given the opportunity to self-nominate for leadership roles. For the senior prefects’ role, the students will also campaign to garner the support of the school population for their nomination and appointment. All student leaders are guided to perform their roles diligently. Student Leaders are developed in both their interpersonal and intrapersonal skills through the exposure and experiences provided in their roles to lead the school community.

**Roles and Responsibilities of Student Leaders (Tier 2 and Tier 3)**  
Our student leaders at Northshore Primary School perform various duties that help to shape a positive and well-functioning school environment.  

•	**Recess Duty**: Prefects are responsible for ensuring order and discipline during recess, helping to create a safe and respectful environment for all students. They are also tasked with resolving any issues that may arise, promoting the values of kindness and respect among their peers.

•	**Recess Games**: Peer Support Leaders (PSLs) play a vital role in facilitating fun and engaging games for students to enjoy during recess. This responsibility allows PSLs to foster a sense of community, encourage teamwork, and ensure that all students have a positive and enjoyable break.

•	**School Events**: Student leaders also assist in organizing school events such as Teacher’s Day, contributing to the celebration and appreciation of teachers and staff.

•	**Voices of Northshoreans**: At Northshore Primary School, every student has a voice in shaping the school’s future. Through Voices of Northshoreans, students are encouraged to share their ideas on how to improve the school environment. Their suggestions are carefully reviewed by a dedicated team of teachers and Prefects before being submitted to the Principal for final consideration. Successful ideas that enhance the school experience are implemented, and students who contribute meaningful changes are recognized for their efforts. As a token of appreciation, specially made bookmarks are given to students who have suggested meaningful and feasible ideas. This initiative empowers students to take an active role in making Northshore Primary a better place for everyone. Every idea counts, and every voice matters!
