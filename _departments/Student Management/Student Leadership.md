# **Student Leadership**

At Northshore, we develop student leadership in each and every Northshorean.  We hope to develop Northshoreans into responsible and conscientious individuals. By partaking in various leadership roles and responsibilities, every Northshorean will be shaped into confident leaders who will lead from their heart.

Our leadership framework provides opportunities for students to grow in responsibility and leadership skills, with each tier designed to challenge and support their personal growth. The framework is structured across three distinct tiers, allowing students to progressively take on more significant roles.

**Tier 1: Class Committee Roles â€“ Introduction to Leadership**
In Tier 1, every student has the opportunity to participate in class committee roles. These positions offer a first step toward leadership, providing students with hands-on experience in organising and working with others. It is a great introduction to the responsibilities and teamwork needed to succeed as a leader, setting the foundation for future leadership opportunities.
