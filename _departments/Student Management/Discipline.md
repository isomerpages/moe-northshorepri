# **Discipline**


In Northshore Primary School, we believe that discipline is an essential component.  We strive to ensure that every student is treated with equity and respect.  We focus on promoting positive behaviour where we celebrate the achievements and contributions of our students.

In addition, we embrace Restorative Practice as a basis of our approach to building and maintaining positive relationships.  Restorative practices focus on repairing harm, restoring relationships, and promoting personal responsibility.   When conflicts arise, we prioritise restorative conferences to address the harm caused and work towards resolutions that repair relationships.  We strongly believe that discipline and restorative practices are integral to fostering a positive and respectful school culture
