# **Applied Learning Programme (ALP)**


![](/images/ALP_Pic00.jpg)

Our ALP “imaginEErs - Creativity unlocked: Excite. Explore. Excel” seeks to provide opportunities for our students to be involved in exciting STEM hands-on activities and encourage them to explore ideas, try out new skills such as basic coding, and be creative, placing great emphasis on cultivating the joy of learning in them. 

Our ALP introduces an innovative approach to STEM education through gamified learning experiences to provide our students with a sense of excitement and enjoyment in their learning. We adopt the ExFactor approach, which is structured in two tiers of learning experiences. The tiered learning experiences aim to encourage mass participation, cultivate interest, and identify and develop talents amongst our students.  At Tier 1, Excite and Explore, we focus on teaching basic game design and making skills to all P1 and P2 students, integrated into their PAL curriculum, to excite the students and encourage them to explore and try out new ideas.  At Tier 2, Explore and Excel, we focus on engaging students who show greater aptitude and interest to participate in competitions related to game design and making through Media and STEM CCA.  

Our Design Process, The Game Plan, has been adapted from the Design Thinking Framework to tie in with the contextual theme of Game Design and Making.  At the Story stage, students will be presented a narrative and where they will have to emphasise and define the problem.  At the Strategise stage, our students are involved in the ideation process to solve the problem that was identified.  At the Challenge stage, students create and test their prototypes, game play and suitability in solving the problem.  At the Level Up stage, students are introduced to an ideation strategy, SCAMPER, to make the necessary changes and improvements to their prototypes.

Through these imaginative learning experiences, we aim to develop our students’ critical, adaptive and inventive thinking skills through student-centred pedagogy and STEM-related dispositions - GRIT (Graciousness, Responsibility, Innovation and Tenacity) and foster communication and collaboration skills while working in teams, to eventually raise them as confident and creative imagineers.
