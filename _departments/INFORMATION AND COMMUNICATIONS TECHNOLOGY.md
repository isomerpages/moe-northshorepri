# **Information And Communications Technology (ICT)**

**Empowering Northshoreans for a Technology-Transformed World**  
In line with the EdTech Masterplan 2030 vision to “prepare students for a technology-transformed world,” Northshore Primary School is committed to nurturing digitally empowered, future-ready learners and innovators. Guided by our ICT Committee, we adopt a whole-school approach to equip every Northshorean with the digital literacy and technological skills needed to thrive in an increasingly digital world.

Our students develop essential digital competencies through the “Find, Think, Apply, Create” framework, which is embedded into a progressive ICT curriculum. This curriculum integrates Baseline ICT Standards and New Media Literacies to ensure a strong foundation in digital learning.


**EdTech Programme Overview**  
At Northshore Primary School, our EdTech curriculum is designed to progressively equip students with essential digital skills and competencies aligned with the MOE's Baseline ICT Standards. With a strong focus on foundational ICT skills, responsible digital citizenship, and exposure to emerging technologies, Northshoreans are empowered to become confident, collaborative, and future-ready digital learners.

With a strong foundation in values and digital skills, Northshoreans grow into confident digital learners with the courage to explore, passion to learn, and heart to serve.
