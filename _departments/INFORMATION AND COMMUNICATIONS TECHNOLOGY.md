# **Information And Communications Technology (ICT)**

**Empowering Northshoreans for a Technology-Transformed World**  
In line with the EdTech Masterplan 2030 vision to “prepare students for a technology-transformed world,” Northshore Primary School is committed to nurturing digitally empowered, future-ready learners and innovators. Guided by our ICT Committee, we adopt a whole-school approach to equip every Northshorean with the digital literacy and technological skills needed to thrive in an increasingly digital world.

Our students develop essential digital competencies through the “Find, Think, Apply, Create” framework, which is embedded into a progressive ICT curriculum. This curriculum integrates Baseline ICT Standards and New Media Literacies to ensure a strong foundation in digital learning.
