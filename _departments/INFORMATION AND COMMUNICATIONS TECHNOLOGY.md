# **Information And Communications Technology (ICT)**

**Empowering Northshoreans for a Technology-Transformed World**  
In line with the EdTech Masterplan 2030 vision to “prepare students for a technology-transformed world,” Northshore Primary School is committed to nurturing digitally empowered, future-ready learners and innovators. Guided by our ICT Committee, we adopt a whole-school approach to equip every Northshorean with the digital literacy and technological skills needed to thrive in an increasingly digital world.

Our students develop essential digital competencies through the **“Find, Think, Apply, Create”** framework, which is embedded into a progressive ICT curriculum. This curriculum integrates Baseline ICT Standards and New Media Literacies to ensure a strong foundation in digital learning.


**EdTech Programme Overview**  
At Northshore Primary School, our EdTech curriculum is designed to progressively equip students with essential digital skills and competencies aligned with the MOE's Baseline ICT Standards. With a strong focus on foundational ICT skills, responsible digital citizenship, and exposure to emerging technologies, Northshoreans are empowered to become confident, collaborative, and future-ready digital learners.  

**Signature Programmes**  

• **imaginEErs – Creativity Unlocked**  
Our ALP  programme, “imaginEErs – Creativity Unlocked”, engages students in exciting, hands-on S.T.E.M. (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) activities. Students embark on imaginative learning adventures that spark curiosity and creativity while building critical and inventive thinking skills to solve real-world problems. This programme also fosters essential communication and collaboration skills.  
• **Makerspace**  
The Makerspace ecosystem encourages design thinking and innovation through hands-on creation and prototyping, giving students the space and tools to explore and build.  
• **Media & STEM Club**  
Through our co-curricular activities in Media & STEM , students explore coding and programming using platforms such as Scratch. They learn to create digital artefacts, develop, test, and debug digital solutions, gaining practical skills in a collaborative and supportive environment.

**Developing Teachers, Deepening EdTech Practices**  
Our educators are empowered through ongoing Professional Development tailored to strengthen their EdTech practices. Through trainings, workshops, mentoring, and peer collaboration, our teachers explore new digital pedagogies and innovate their classroom practices. This professional growth supports the creation of meaningful and tech-enriched learning experiences for our students.

**Cyber Wellness Education**  
Cyber wellness education is integrated into our Character and Citizenship Education curriculum, helping students develop responsible digital habits and positive online behaviour. With a strong foundation in values and digital skills, Northshoreans grow into confident digital learners with the courage to explore, passion to learn, and heart to serve.
