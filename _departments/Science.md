At Northshore Primary, we believe that all children are musical and have the innate ability to listen, sing, dance, play and express themselves musically.&nbsp; We have developed a well-tailored curriculum which provides different learning experiences to develop studentsâ€™ musical abilities through the E-C-A (Experience-Concept-Application) approach.
