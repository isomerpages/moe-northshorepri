**II. Primary Science Syllabus**  
The Primary Science Syllabus aims to provide students with experiences/opportunities to:  
* Build on their interest and stimulate their curiosity about themselves and their environment.

* Develop skills, dispositions, and attitudes for scientific inquiry.

**III. Pedagogy**  
Our pedagogy is rooted in the belief that all students are curious and want to explore and learn about things around them.  
As such, we aim to nurture our students as inquirers through opportunities for them to explore and to appreciate the role of Science for Life and Society. These opportunities allow them to build on the core ideas, practices, values, ethics and attitudes of science as they learn with others, learn using resources and learn in different environments.

**Science Explorers**  
Science Explorer at Northshore Primary aims to provide students with the experiences to extend their learning of Science. These experiences include activities that allow them to connect the knowledge with real world applications and for them to show a deeper appreciation of science based on the contributions of scientists past and present.  

The Science Explorer activities has been designed to allow our Northshoreans to see the world through the lens of scientists by experiencing the practices of Science and understanding the nature of Science as a reliable, durable and evidence-based subject of knowledge.
