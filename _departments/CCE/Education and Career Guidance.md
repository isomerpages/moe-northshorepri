# **Education and Career Guidance (ECG)**



Education and Career Guidance (ECG) helps students develop a sense of purpose in life. By nurturing self-awareness and self-directedness for lifelong learning, ECG helps students develop a growth mindset, adaptability and a resilient attitude to embrace future opportunities and appreciate the value of all occupations.

**Goals of ECG**  
The goals of ECG (Figure 1) are to support students in:
* Discovering purpose - Who am I?  
Nurture students' self-awareness to support them in discovering how they can meaningfully play a part in their community.
* Exploring opportunities - Where do I want to go?  
Develop students' self-directedness and confidence to explore and leverage education and career opportunities while respecting the value of all occupations.
* Staying relevant - How do I get there?  
Build students' adaptability and resilience to embrace the need for lifelong learning.
