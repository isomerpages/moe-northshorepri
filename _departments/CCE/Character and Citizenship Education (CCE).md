# **Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)**

CCE aims to develop good character, resilience, social-emotional well-being, future readiness and active citizenship in our students.  CCE lessons include CCE Form Teacher Guidance Period (CCE FTGP), CCE Mother Tongue Languages (CCE MTL) and Programme for Active Learning (PAL).  Key student development experiences provide an authentic learning platform that contribute to the holistic development of Northshoreans.  

**CCE at Northshore**  

Northshore, CCE is guided by the School Vision and S.M.A.R.T¹ values. (¹S.M.A.R.T acronym: Self-discipline, eMpathy. Adaptability, Respect and Tenacity). The school uses a two-tier “2E” developmental and progressive approach to develop Northshoreans.

The “2E” approach is as follows: 

*   Engage (Tier 1): Engage and develop all students holistically through intentional teaching of knowledge, social-emotional skills, values and attitudes.
*   Empower (Tier 2): Empower students who exhibit greater aptitude and interest to drive ground-up initiatives, lead actively in school programmes and be a positive peer influence.
