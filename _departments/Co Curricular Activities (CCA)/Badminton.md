Our Badminton CCA started in 2024. It comprises of 43 active and enthusiastic young players enhancing their knowledge badminton sport and skills on focusing, quick decision-making, winning and losing and how to deal with both. The sport enables them to learn and cultivate good values such as responsibility, adaptability, tenacity and teamwork. Players enhance their ability to trust and let go when playing with their partners and also learn about respect and sportsmanship while playing with their opponents.  While building social connections, our players enhance their communication skills too. Players will be trained for school and inter-school tournaments and friendly matches with other schools.
