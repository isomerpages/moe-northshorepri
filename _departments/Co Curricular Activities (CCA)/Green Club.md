# **Green Club**

The Green Club at Northshore Primary School fosters a passion for environmental service through our values of "eMpathy and Respect." We aim to create awareness in our Green Club members about biodiversity and human impacts on the environment, cultivating knowledge (HEAD) and inspiring actions (HEART and HANDS). Green Club members participate in various activities within the club, such as creating green spaces in school, as well as joining external programs. The club strives to nurture and inspire environmentally conscious individuals who actively contribute to conservation efforts, embodying empathy, respect, and a proactive commitment to environmental well-being in Northshore Primary School.
