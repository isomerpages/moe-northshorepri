# **Basketball Girls**

Basketball is a team sport played between two teams, each comprised of five players. The game revolves around a dynamic blend of offensive and defensive strategies, as teams strive to outscore each other within a designated time. Beyond its competitive nature, basketball also serves as a platform for players to nurture essential values and life skills. These include but are not limited to Self-discipline, Empathy, Adaptability, Respect, Tenacity â€” aligning seamlessly with the core values upheld by schools.

Our basketball Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) boasts participation from both P3 and P4 girls, engaging in bi-weekly training sessions scheduled for every Tuesday and Friday.
