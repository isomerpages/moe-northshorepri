# **Media & STEM Club**

The Media & STEM Club offers an exciting platform for students to delve into the realms of coding and tinkering. Through engaging activities, such as Swift Playgrounds, students immerse themselves in app design and development, honing their skills for the digital age. They will eventually participate in the Swift Explorers Challenge, showcasing their innovative app creations. Alongside coding, tinkering activities abound, with makerspace projects like constructing solar-powered cars and making scribble bots. Through coding challenges and tinkering projects, students are constantly pushed to think critically, problem-solve and innovate. They learn to analyse complex problems, break them down into manageable components, and devise creative solutions. This dynamic blend of technology and creativity fosters a vibrant learning environment, where members unleash their potential and embrace the endless possibilities of media and STEM exploration.
