# **Co-Curricular Activities (CCA)**

CCA (Co-curricular activities) is an integral part of our studentsâ€™ holistic education. Through CCA, students discover their interests and talents while developing values and competencies that will prepare them for a rapidly changing world. CCA also promotes friendships among students from diverse backgrounds as they learn, play and grow together. Through CCA, students also develop a sense of identity and belonging to the school.
