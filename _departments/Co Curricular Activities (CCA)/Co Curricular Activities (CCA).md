# **Co-Curricular Activities (CCA)**

CCA (Co-curricular activities) is an integral part of our studentsâ€™ holistic education. Through CCA, students discover their interests and talents while developing values and competencies that will prepare them for a rapidly changing world. CCA also promotes friendships among students from diverse backgrounds as they learn, play and grow together. Through CCA, students also develop a sense of identity and belonging to the school.  

In Northshore Primary School, students can select from a variety of CCAs based on their interests and abilities. The school now has 11 CCAs from the 4 main groups, namely Physical Sports, Visual and Performing Arts, Uniformed Groups and Clubs & Societies. As the school continues to expand in terms of student population, we will be introducing more CCAs from the 4 CCA groups to allow students more choices. More information will be shared at a later date.
