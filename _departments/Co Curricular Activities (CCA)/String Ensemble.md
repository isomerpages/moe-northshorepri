# **String Ensemble**

The String Ensemble welcomes students with a love for music. Open to both beginners and experienced players, the ensemble provides students with the opportunity to learn and perform on string instruments such as the violin and cello. It introduces students to the fundamentals of music theory and technical aspects of the instruments in the string family.

Through guided instruction and ensemble practices, students will develop essential musical skills and a deeper appreciation for orchestral music. In String Ensemble, students learn the importance of respect, teamwork and tenacity as they work together to perform as a group and play in harmony. Throughout the year, students will have opportunities to showcase their talents in school performances and events. This builds their self-confidence and spreads the joy of making music with others.
