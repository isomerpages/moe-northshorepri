# **Modern Dance**

 Northshore Modern Dance aims to provide a vibrant platform for students to explore their creativity and expressiveness through movement. Our sessions are a dynamic blend of choreography and music, where dancers not only refine their technique but also develop confidence and teamwork skills. Opportunities will also be given to students to display their artistic flair through SYF Arts Presentation and school performances.
