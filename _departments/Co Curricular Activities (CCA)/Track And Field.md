# **Track And Field**

Track and Field as a Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) emphasizes on discipline, perseverance, and teamwork. It offers a platform for students to develop physical strength, agility, and mental resilience through its weekly training sessions with our qualified coaches. Participation in the CCA also presents students with the opportunity to compete in the National School Games in various events like sprints, long-distance running, and field events such as high jump and shot put. The CCA fosters a sense of camaraderie as athletes support and encourage each other to reach personal and team goals. It instills valuable life skills like time management, dedication, and sportsmanship, helping students grow both physically and mentally while building character and a strong sense of achievement in a competitive yet supportive environment.
