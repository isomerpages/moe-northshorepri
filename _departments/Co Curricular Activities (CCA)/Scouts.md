# **Scouts (Boys and Girls)**

The objective of the Cub Scout programme is to develop our students in an environment that is intellectually and physically stimulating as well as providing challenges for the child to face and overcome.

Our Northshore Cub Scout gathers weekly. They are led by our Akelas. Cubs learn to manage themselves and take care of their peers. In doing so, they get hands-on leadership experience.

Northshore Cub Scouts is part of the North Area Cub Scouts in Singapore. This CCA was started in 2023 with our first batch of P3s in Northshore Primary School. Today, we have a total of 41 cub scouts in our unit. Our weekly activities encourage our Cubs to take ownership of themselves and grow. Pack meetings are opportunities for adventures, learning life skills, outdoor cooking, games, knotting, craftwork and other scouting skills, while making new friends.
